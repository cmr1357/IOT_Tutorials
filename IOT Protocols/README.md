# IoT Protocols.

Friends! now that you have got some basic ideas about the Internet of Things. 

Now let us discuss IoT communication protocols.
Firstly protocols are modes of communication that protect and ensure optimum security of the data being exchanged between devices.
Most IoT devices are connected to the internet via an IP. However, to connect devices locally Bluetooth and RFID technology can be used. 

Which technology you should select depends on your application.

There are mainly two types of IoT protocols

1. IoT Network Protocols
2. IoT Data Protocols.


## IoT Network Protocol

IoT network protocol is designed to connect medium to high-power devices over the network.
It allows data communication within the scope of the network.
http://, Zigbee, Bluetooth, LoRaWAN are examples of some of the popular IoT protocols. 

## IoT Data Protocol

IoT Data Protocol is designed to connect low-power devices.

The connectivity in IoT data protocols and standards is through a wired or cellular network.
MQTT, CoAP, AMQP, XMPP are some basic examples of IoT data protocols.

Now let us discuss some popular IoT protocols one by one.

### Wi-Fi

It is IEEE 802.11n standard-based, working in a frequency range of 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz band.
The Range of IOT devices can go up from 50 meters to 100 meters. And the data rate generally varies between 150 to 200 Mbps and it has a maximum data rate of 600 Mbps.

### Bluetooth

It is Bluetooth 4.2 core specification. with a frequency range of 2.4 GHz ISM band. It ranges from Approximately 50 meters to 150 meters. And a data rate 1Mbps.

### ZigBee 

Zigbee 3.0 is based on IEE802.15.4 standard. Its frequency range is about 2.4 GHz band and the range is approximately 10 to 100 meters and the data rate of maximum 150 Kbps.

### MQTT

MQTT stands for Message Queue Telemetry Transport protocol. It is ISO or IEC 20922 standard protocol.
Its data rates can go up to 256Mb. We will be discussing this protocol in detail.

### OPC UA

OPC UA is one of the important communication protocols for industry 4.o and the IoT .
It comes under the industrial M2M communication protocol like MQTT it is a platform independent standard by which various systems and devices can communicate by sending request and response messages between the clients. 

### Cellular Network

Cellular network is based on GSM/GPRS/EDGE(2G), UMTS/HSPA(3G),LTE(4G) standard. 
And the frequency range of 900Mhz, 1.8/1.9/2.1 GHz. 
for GSM, 200Km for HSPA. It range varies approximately from 35km and the data rate for downloading is an average of 35.170kbps.

### Z Wave

Z Wave is an aligned standard and its frequency varies depending upon the manufacturer. Its range varies from approximately 30m to 40m.
and its data rate is approximately .3 to 50 Kbps. This wireless communication protocol is based on low-power RF communication technology.
It is highly preferable for home automation. 

### NFC

NFC stands for Near- Field_communication it is ISO/IEC 18000-3 based standard. Its frequency range varies between 13.56 GHz ISM band and the range is approximately 10cm. Its data rate is between 400 to 420 Kbps.
NFC is one of the various communication protocols these days.

### LoRaWAN 

LoRaWAN stands for Long Range Wide-Area-Network. The LoRaWAN frequency depends upon the frequency of the manufacturer.
Its range is approximately 2.5km in the urban environment and 15km in suburban and its data rate is between .3 to 50 kbps.

### sigfox 

sigfox is based on Sigfox standrd. and its frequency range is about 900MHz and its range varies approximately 30-50 km in a rural environment. and between 3 to 10 Km in an urban environment.
Its data rate is between .3 to 50Kbps.
